The planet’s lithosphere is broken into large tectonic plates that float on the semi‑fluid asthenosphere beneath them.

In short, earthquakes are the manifestation of the Earth constantly adjusting to the forces that drive plate motion.\n",

When a hive becomes crowded or the queen’s pheromone levels drop, a portion of the worker bees, together with the old queen, leave the original nest to find a new home.

When a hive is threatened (e.g., by predators, extreme temperature, or disturbance), a large group of bees may exit together to overwhelm the threat or to relocate to a safer site. The mass departure could also be a way to confuse predators, making it harder for them to target a single bee or the queen.\n",
